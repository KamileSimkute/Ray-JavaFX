#Ray Tracer Project (JavaFX)

This project implements a basic ray tracer in JavaFX, focusing on ray-sphere intersection, shading models, and interactive rendering. The goal is to create a simple ray tracer with support for multiple spheres, ambient/diffuse shading, and interactive color adjustments using sliders.

Key Features:
Ray-Sphere Intersection: Calculates the intersection between a ray and spheres in 3D space.

Shading Model: Implements ambient and diffuse shading based on a simple model.

Multiple Spheres: Supports rendering of multiple spheres with individual colors.

Interactive UI: Allows users to change sphere colors using RGB sliders.

Code Improvements: Refactor code to allow for multiple spheres, better structure, and reusable components like sphere class and material properties.
